# OTRobotics_Training_2021
This is going to be the folder 
that you are going to be using to 
organize all of your notes

If you missed a lesson and would like to see
the completed notes, then visit the FRCOffseason Github: 
https://github.com/clarrie-w/Offseason-Training-2021

This repository is meant to be your own and a way for 
you to get comfortable coding so you are ready to program
a robot :)
